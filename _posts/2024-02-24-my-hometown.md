This first question is:
#### Where is your hometown ?

Well, my hometown is a little *village* in the middle of EngLand, in that they call the Midlands.

The next question is: Do you like the hometown ?
Yes, I find it really calming and relaxing, especially when I'm comeback to the village from the city where I live.
Life is so much calmer there. I would say that only a thounsand people live in my hometown and they all live in nice house with beautiful gardens and flowers, 
so it's the total opposite of where I live in a flat in  my city.

The next question is: Do you often visit your hometown ?

I usually visit my hometown at the weekends when i have time, so that might maybe 10 times a year. Sometimes I spend a week there in my summer
holidays because it's just a nice place to stay. I normally stay with ny family at one of their houses so I don't stay there for a long time.

The next question is: What is the oldest place in your hometown ?

I would say that the oldest place, the oldest building, is the church, which is in the centre.
There aren't many shops in my hometown but the ones that we have are next to the church, so they are in the village centre as well. 
There is a **butcher's**, there is a **bakery**, a bank and one small supermarket. Even though there aren't a lot of shop, you can always 
find what you need and if you need anything else, you can go to a nearby city and that only takes 30 minutes.

The following question is: How could your hometown be improved ? 

Well, the roads aren't very good in my hometown and it **seems** like this  is problem all over England.

So when i take my bike to my hometown to go **cycling**, sometimes i can't because the roads are  so bad. 

**Have your hometown changed much since you were a child ?**

I would say that the main things that have changed about my hometown are the people that live there. Nowadays, there are a lot of younger people 
who have decided to leave the city and to move to the countryside to this small village. So it's nice to see that the village will have 
a  future and maybe one day i will go back there and live there as well.

**The next question is: Is there good public **transportation** in your hometown  ? **

The transportation in my hometown isn't the best. There  isn't a **train link** but there are quite  a lot of **buses** that go by, so if you haven't 
got a car you would go by bus to  different places.
As I  said before, there aren't a lot of shops in my hometown, so I would say that **almost** all of the people that live in the village have a car because
you need it to travel to work to nearby city, where most people work.

**And the final question is: Do you think your hometown is a good place to bring up children ??**

Yes, I think that is the perfect place to bring up children because almost all of the house have big gardens and children can have **trampolines**,
swings or even **climbing frames** in their garden, and I think that makes a lot of children happy. 
The Internet connection is also good in the village as well, so that's important because a lot of children love that.
