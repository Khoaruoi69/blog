### Pets

Pets are the animals that live with us in our homes. There are a lots of pets that you can have. The most popular pets in the United Kingdom are dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, fish and birds.

Other pets that people can have are snakes, lizards, tortoises, and **parrots**, but they aren't not popular.

**What pets do you have in your country ?**

People have pets because they can play with them, **go for a walk** with them, **hug** and kiss them, and do a lot of things with them. Pets are like friends or family
for  some people . They make a lot of people happy.

In the United Kingdom, 50% of people have a pet, so there are a lots  of pets in the country ! There are 10 milion dogs and 11 milions cats, so there are more cats than dogs.

When I was a child, I had a lot of pets. I had cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, fish and tortoises.

Cats and dogs are my favourite pets. They are my favourite pets because they love their owners. I think that pets like fish, hamsters, lizards or snakes don't love you.
They only love you because you give them food.

You can play with cats and dogs, sleep with them, hug and kiss them, and they like to be with you.

Rabbits and guinea pigs are good pets because they easy to look after. They can live outside or in your house in a **cage**.

They are small pets and they are very fluffy and soft. They like playing, running and sleeping. They eat grass and vegetables. They are easy to look after because you don't need to walk them.

**Do you think that rabbits and guinea pigs are good pets ?**

Snakes., lizard and other reptiles are difficult to look after.

When I was a child, I had an iguana and a tortoise. Reptiles need to be warn or hot, not cold, so it is more difficult to look  after them. Also, some reptiles eat **strange foods** like **insects** or small animals like mice.

I loved my iguana and my tortoise because they are amazing animals, but I think that they are not the best pets because they don't give you love.

Birds like **parrots or budgies**, are good pets for some people because they like to play and sing. Sometimes they are great pets if you have a graden.

Finally, fish are popular pets because they are easy to look after, they are beautiful and they are relaxing to look at. When I was a child, i had a lot of fish in a **fish tank** in my bedroom. I loved my fish and I think that they are a great pet for children.
