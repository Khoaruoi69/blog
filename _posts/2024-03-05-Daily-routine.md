Like before i said.  Before i  go to bed, i tidy my house because when you wake up in the morning and the house is clear, it's great. You start the day feeling verry happy and more relaxed. So I start tidy my house at 10 or half pass 10 and then I start to get ready for bed. 
I don't look at my phone before i go to sleep because i read online that it is bad; your brain is active. So, I don't read or use any technology before I go to bed.
