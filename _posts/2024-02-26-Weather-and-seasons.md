**What seasons do you have in your country ?**

In the UK, we have the four seasons. We have winter, when it is a little bit  cold and sometimes it snows, then we have spring, when the weather is warm
and there are a lot of flowers, thirdly there is the summer, which is hot but not very hot if we compare it to other countries like Spain, and then
finally we have autumn, which is similar to spring but the leaves of the trees fall off and it is very beautiful. 

which is your favorite seasons ? My favorite season is summer because it is quite hot and you can do a lot of things outside, for example,
you can go for walk on the beach, you can be outside in your garden, you can have *barbecue* or just go to the park.

**Is your country popular with tourists in every seasons ?** 

I think in UK is  popular tourists in every season but the most important season for tourism is summer. There are a lot of people that come to the UK 
in June, July, August but a lot of people come to LonDon, for example, during all the year.

*in the second part of this speaking test i have to describe a type of weather that i don't like*

i don't like rain. This is not very good because in England there is a lot of rain. Sometimes it rains every day for two weeksk, but other times it once per
week, so it just *depends* on the week, on the seasons really. ... i don't like rain is because when is raining you can't go outside and do you thing that you like 
to do, for example, you can't go the beach, you can't go the park and it makes you a little sad. 

*In the third part i have to give my opinion on some topics*

**Do you think the weather makes people sad or happy ?**

Yes, i think that when weather is sunny and it's very hot people are happier because they can do more thing and they can go to outside. 
but I think that when it is raining and it's cold people feel very sad

**The next question is: What are some example a bad weather ?** 

well, i think that the main examples bad weather are rain, storms, and maybe snow. Snow can be good for some people but other people hate snow because you can't go to work,
can't go to school. But in England the main examples of bad weather normally rain or storms.

**And finally the last question is: How do you look at the weather ?**

Well, i normally look online to see what the weather is going to be like. Google normally tells me what the weather is going to be like today, tomorrow.
But normally i don't look at it, only if i'm going to do something special like for example go to the beach or go somewhere outside where i know that i can't go if
it rains.
